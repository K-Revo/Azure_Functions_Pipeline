# Description: 

 This is one of many ongoing projects to showcase my Data Engineering Skills. This project is not an accurate sample of my overall skillset as this is a prototype.
 This simple pipeline was designed to maximize Azure's free tier subscriptions to implement a simple, running data pipeline, mainly to showcase proof-of-concept.
 This is only using a JSON Placeholder API to test for functioning logic. This will be replaced with a more practical data API for future projects/developments.
